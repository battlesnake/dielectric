Description:
	Perform spectral analysis (acoustic or electrical resistance) with your
	sound card.

	Musician-class sound cards from the early to mid 2000s had some nice
	technical features, before the entire market got drowned with the "HD"
	fad.  An old Audigy 2 card can sample and drive with nearly 24-bit
	resolution, at 192 kHz.

	The front-speaker and headphone outputs have lowpass filters which cut
	anything above 25 kHz, so use the rear-speaker output for your drive
	signal, and try each input until you find one that isn't bandpass-
	restricted to the audio range.  If you can use the kX drivers
	[www.kxproject.com] instead of the standard Creative ones, it may help.
	Be sure to select the correct input channel in the Windows audio mixer.

Usage:
	When the program is run, it will go through a series of prompts.
	    A.	Select input device (e.g. kX Wave SBxxxx 10k2 0/1) - the device
		to use for performing measurements.
	    B.	Select output device (kX Wave SBxxxx 10k2 2/3) - the device to
		emit the drive signal through.
	    C.	The sweep duration (ideally, at least 10 seconds per decade of
		sweep range)
	    D.	The start frequency of the sweep
	    E.	The end frequency of the sweep
	    F.	The name of the dataset (will overwrite existing ones with the
		same name)

	I'll add some proper example schematics for electrical spectroscopy
	when I have the time.  Drive across a potential divider, with a
	resistor on the drive side of the divider and the subject to examine
	on the grounded side.  The "microphone" line in the middle of the
	divider is of course where the measurement is taken from.

	The ground lines of the in/out lines should be connected together, and
	to the sample ground.  This is shown in the above diagram as one ground
	connection on the PC.


	After that, hit <ENTER> to start and grab a coffee while the scan
	progresses.  The data is saved in CSV format, which any good analysis
	software (and also Excel) will have no problem accessing.
